                <p> By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make
                    sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or
                    modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
                    to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
                    other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                    database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Hassan
                    Hussein. </p>
                <p> Hassan Hussein is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
                    any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making
                    it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for. </p>
                <p> The Cashei app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my
                    Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
                    recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
                    software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
                    It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
                    phone’s security features and it could mean that the Cashei app won’t work properly or at all.

                    <p> The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. </p>

                <p> You should be aware that there are certain things that Hassan Hussein will not take
                    responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
                    connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Hassan
                    Hussein cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
                    have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p> If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
                    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                    your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                    app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any
                    such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                    (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
                    device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
                    permission from the bill payer for using the app. </p>
                <p> Along the same lines, Hassan Hussein cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
                    app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
                    you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Hassan Hussein cannot accept responsibility. </p>
                <p> With respect to Hassan Hussein’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the
                    app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
                    correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can
                    make it available to you. Hassan Hussein accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                    you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. </p>
                <p> At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp;
                    iOS – the requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend
                    the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
                    to keep using the app. Hassan Hussein does not promise that it will always update the app so
                    that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                    installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
                    offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
                    time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
                    termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
                    stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device. </p>
                <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
                <p> I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this
                    page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                    Conditions on this page. </p>
